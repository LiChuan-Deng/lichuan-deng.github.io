Hi! My name is Lichuan Deng.

I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at the [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), IA, US. Before that, I obtained my B.S in Mathematics and B.Econ in Finance from [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/), Chengdu, China.

I hope that in the future, I can work with the professors of ISU to make further research on deep learning and applications, and have the opportunity to become an AI algorithm research engineer.
