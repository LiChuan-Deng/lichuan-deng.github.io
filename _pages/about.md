Hi, it's  my homepage!

I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at the [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). Prior to this, I earned a B.S in Mathematics and B.Econ in Finance from [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/).

<!-- I hope that in the future, I can work with the professors of ISU to make further research, and have the opportunity to become an algorithm research engineer.

Recently, my interest is in theoretical algorithm research. In the next few years, I may be interested in some applied technologies. -->
