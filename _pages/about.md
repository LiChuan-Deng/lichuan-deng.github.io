Hi! I'm Lichuan Deng.

I became a Ph.D. student of the [Dept. of CS](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at the [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in the Fall of 2020. Before that, I obtained my B.S in Mathematics and B.Econ in Finance from [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/), Chengdu, China.

My full CV is available [here](CV.pdf).
