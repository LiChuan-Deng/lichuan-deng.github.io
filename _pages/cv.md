# Experience

## Research Assistant
- **Organization:** Iowa State University
- **Date:** Aug 2021 - Current
- **Description:** 
  - Supervised by Dr. Gianfranco Ciardo and Dr. Andrew S. Miner, developing and implementing the project that extends and improves the efficiency and applicability of binary decision diagrams (BDDs): [RexBDD](https://github.com/asminer/RexDD)
  - Implemented the canonical RexBDDs and compared different numbers of variants BDDs' nonterminal nodes encoding all Boolean functions up to 5 variables
  - Developed a BLIF parser to construct RexBDD representations encoding combinatory circuits through logical operations
  - Developing a library for supporting various forms of BDDs to encode functions with various ranges and dynamic reduction rules, possibly with edge values, swap flags, and complement flags
  - Designing and implementing RexBDD-based state relation functionality for the model checker's future enhancements

## Systems Engineer Intern
- **Organization:** Collins Aerospace
- **Date:** May 2023 - Aug 2023
- **Description:**
  - Collaborated with Dr. Gianfranco Ciardo, Dr. Andrew S Miner, and [Dr. Junaid Babar (Collins Aerospace)](https://loonwerks.com/people/junaid-babar.html) to successfully develop and implement key algorithms for *RexBDD* logical operations. Additionally, implemented the garbage collection mechanism and a suite of essential helper functions to construct RexBDD based on truth tables.
  - Leveraging the RexBDD library to implement the back-end CTL and LTL algorithms for the future model checker projects
