title: "RexBDDs: reduction-on-edge complement-and-swap binary decision diagrams"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024DAC-RexBDDs
excerpt: 'We introduce RexBDDs, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) that exploit reduction opportunities well beyond those of reduced ordered BDDs, zero-suppressed BDDs, and recent proposals integrating multiple reduction rules.
RexBDDs also leverage (output) complement flags and (input) swap flags to potentially decrease the number of nodes by a factor of four.
We define a reduced form of RexBDDs that ensures canonicity, and use a set of benchmarks to demonstrate their superior storage and runtime requirements compared to previous alternatives.'
